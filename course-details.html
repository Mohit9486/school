                        This course is designed to build foundational skills in phonics and math. It is divided into four levels:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Level 1 (Age 3-4.5):</strong> Letter sounds, phonemic awareness, foundational math.</li>

                            title: "Level 1 (Age 3–4.5)",
                            description: `This level serves as a fun and interactive introduction to both phonics and numbers, designed to engage early learners in developing foundational skills that will support their academic growth. The phonics component begins with teaching the sounds of individual letters, emphasizing how each letter’s sound connects to words in their everyday environment. Through hands-on activities like tracing, matching, and letter recognition games, children not only learn the alphabet but also the beginning sounds of words, helping them establish early phonemic awareness.
                            <br><br>
                            As they progress, learners are introduced to the important skill of identifying and filling in missing letters within words. This exercise reinforces their understanding of letter patterns, sounds, and how they form words, laying the groundwork for early reading and spelling skills. Songs, rhymes, and playful storytelling are integrated throughout the process to make learning both engaging and memorable.
                            <br><br>
                            In addition to phonics, children are introduced to the world of numbers through fun and hands-on activities. They explore number sense by engaging in counting activities, identifying and recognizing numbers in various contexts, and learning about basic patterns such as shapes, colors, and sequences. Simple comparisons such as "more," "less," and "equal" are taught to help children understand basic mathematical concepts in a concrete way.
                            <br><br>
                            The activities are designed to be playful, promoting a love of learning through movement, music, and stories. The use of visual aids, number games, and interactive math challenges ensures that the learning experience is fun while also fostering critical thinking and problem-solving skills. By the end of this level, children will have developed a strong, joyful foundation in both phonics and math that prepares them for the next stages of their educational journey.`
                        },
                        {
                            title: "Level 2 (Age 4–5.5/6)",
                            description: `At this level, children take an important leap forward in their reading journey, marking a significant milestone in their literacy development. They start to confidently blend individual letter sounds to form and read short CVC (consonant-vowel-consonant) words. This foundational skill boosts their ability to decode simple words, laying the groundwork for more advanced reading skills in the future. As their phonemic awareness improves, children begin reading simple sentences independently, growing their reading fluency and comprehension.
                            <br><br>
                            Alongside this, the curriculum introduces commonly used sight words, which are crucial for building reading speed and accuracy. These words are often irregular or don't follow typical phonetic rules, so recognizing them by sight helps children become more fluent readers. Basic spelling patterns are also introduced, allowing children to make connections between how words are formed and how they are spelled. This approach not only enhances reading skills but also boosts early writing abilities as children begin to apply their understanding of letter sounds and spelling patterns in their own writing.
                            <br><br>
                            In math, the curriculum shifts focus to foundational concepts that form the basis of early mathematical thinking. Children are introduced to simple addition and subtraction through hands-on activities that use visual aids, such as counters, blocks, and everyday objects, making abstract concepts more tangible. Real-life examples, such as sharing toys or distributing snacks, provide meaningful contexts for practicing these operations.
                            <br><br>
                            Additionally, children explore shapes and measurements, developing a solid understanding of geometric concepts and spatial awareness. They learn to identify and classify basic shapes like circles, squares, and triangles, as well as concepts like length, weight, and volume. Basic comparisons, such as "longer," "shorter," "heavier," and "lighter," help children start to think logically and make connections between numbers and the world around them. These activities engage their problem-solving skills in a fun and interactive way, fostering a love of learning and developing the critical thinking skills they will build upon in later stages. By the end of this level, children will have a well-rounded foundation in both reading and math, setting them up for greater academic success in the years to come.`

                            description: `At this stage, students begin to read fluently with clear understanding and confidence. They don’t just decode words — they start to make sense of what they’re reading, express thoughts, and answer questions based on the text. The focus here is on developing deeper reading skills, learning advanced spelling rules, and understanding how different letter combinations (like digraphs and vowel teams) work together to form sounds. Vocabulary building becomes more intentional, and children are encouraged to use new words in context to enhance both their speaking and writing abilities.
                            <br><br>
                            In math, the learning becomes more structured and thought-driven. Children engage in critical thinking tasks that go beyond basic computation. They learn to identify and differentiate between even and odd numbers, read and interpret simple graphs, and begin solving word problems that require logical reasoning. This level sets the stage for tackling more complex problems by introducing structured formats and step-by-step thinking strategies, preparing them for higher academic challenges ahead.`

They begin using advanced comprehension strategies to understand context, infer meaning, and think critically about what they read. Complex sentence construction becomes a key part of learning — students begin to write longer, well-structured sentences using correct grammar, punctuation, and varied vocabulary. They also learn advanced spelling rules, helping them decode and spell multisyllabic and tricky words with confidence. Grammar concepts are explored in greater depth, including parts of speech, subject-verb agreement, and sentence editing.
                            <br><br>
                            In math, students transition into more abstract and multi-step problem solving. They work with larger numbers and tackle topics like fractions, multiplication, and division, while also applying these skills to real-world situations. Logical reasoning becomes a core focus as children are encouraged to explain their thinking and approach problems in different ways. This level prepares them for independent academic work and sharpens their ability to connect concepts across subjects.`

                            In language arts, students focus on key elements of grammar, including sentence formation, tenses, punctuation, and paragraph writing. They learn to construct grammatically correct sentences with attention to subject-verb agreement, proper word order, and the use of descriptive language. Understanding tenses (past, present, future) is emphasized, helping students communicate more precisely and coherently. Punctuation is taught as an essential tool for conveying meaning and clarity in writing, covering periods, commas, question marks, quotation marks, and other punctuation marks. Students also work on paragraph writing, learning to organize ideas logically and develop coherent thoughts. By practicing comprehension strategies, they improve their ability to understand and analyze texts, enabling them to engage deeply with a wide range of reading materials.`
